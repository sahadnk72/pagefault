title: How I hacked into Oculus VR Developer Portal
---

---


Oculus VR - one of the Facebook acquisitions, was vulnerable to many severe issues including RCE, multiple SQL-injections, and a couple of CSRFs.

Many researchers including Jon of Bitquark, Inti De Ceukelaire and Josip FranjkoviÄ‡ squeezed it to a more secure level. I knew that all the low hanging fruits must had been gone. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot. It is my second finding on Oculus; first was something which allowed me to add anyone's email to an account and verify it without their interaction by crafting a verification link; which led to full account takeover. This one is also somewhat similar, which enabled me to reset random-user's password resulting in successful authentication into their account. Each time I reproduced the request, got access to different accounts, which in turn changed their passwords as well.

I kept trying with fuzzing in different ways to see if anomaly occurs and that's when I decided to pass query parameters as array instead of a string type. And that got paid off.

Here I used array type in query parameters to confuse the web application which must have resulted in skipping some condition checks in the logic responsible for the password reset functionality.

Boom!! Keep fuzzing until you find the hole!!


A nice bounty followed up after it was reported to the Facebook security team.


Thanks for reading!

title: How I hacked into Oculus VR Developer Portal
---

---


Oculus VR - one of the Facebook acquisitions,was vulnerable to many severe issues including RCE,multiple SQL-injection,and multiple CSRFs.
Many researchers such as Jon of Bitquark,Inti De Ceukelaire,Josip FranjkoviÄ‡ squeezed it to a more secure level.I knew that all the low hanging fruits might had gone.Nevertheless,I gave it a shot.It is my second finding on Oculus; first was something which allowed me to add anyone's email to an account and verify it without their interaction by crafting a verification link.This is also somewhat similar,which enabled me to reset someone's password and allowed to authenticate into their account.Each time I reproduced the request,got access to different accounts,which in turn changed their password as well.

After trying with many known tricks to bypass the protection there, and with zero results, an idea struck my mind. This trick used arrays in query parameters to confuse the web application and give out what I really wanted.

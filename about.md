I'm a web-app security enthusiast based in India. Passionate about bug bounties, penetration testing/red teaming. Have developed a few web-apps, helped vendors patch vulnerabilities in their systems. While not making things, I'm breaking things. Currently, working as AppSec Engineer for Envestnet Yodlee. Oh, did I forget to mention that I like to travel and eat (a lot)?

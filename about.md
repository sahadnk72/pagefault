I'm a web-app security enthusiast based in India. Passionate about bug bounties, penetration testing/red teaming. Have developed a few web-apps, helped vendors patch vulnerabilities in their systems and also wasted a damn amount of time pursuing something that was not my thing. While I'm not making things, I'm breaking things.

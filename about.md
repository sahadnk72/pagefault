Web-app security enthusiast based in India. Passionate about hacking, security and such. Have developed a few web-apps, helped vendors patch vulnerabilities in their systems and blah blah blah. While not making things, I'm not making things. Currently, working as an AppSec Engineer for Envestnet Yodlee. Did I forget to mention that I love to travel and eat (a lot)?

Application security enthusiast based in India. Passionate in security, defense and such. Have developed a few web-apps, helped vendors patch vulnerabilities in their systems and blah blah blah. While not making things, I'm not making things. Currently, working as AppSec Engineer for Envestnet Yodlee. I can do security audits for you. I love to travel and eat (a lot). Do you have a job that requires travelling around the world? It's me who you're looking for. LOL.
